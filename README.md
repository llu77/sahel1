# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Development

```bash
npm install     # Install dependencies
npm run build   # Build the application
npm run dev     # Start development server on port 3000
```

### Port Configuration

If port 3000 is already in use:
```bash
npm run dev:3001  # Run on port 3001
```

For more port configuration options, see [docs/PORT_CONFIGURATION.md](docs/PORT_CONFIGURATION.md).
